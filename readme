# Assignment 1 – Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python

This repository contains a Python program that performs the four fundamental arithmetic operations on two numbers entered by the user.

---

## 📌 Features

- Takes **two integer inputs** from the user.
- Performs:
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division  
- Displays each result clearly to the user.

---

## 🧠 How the Program Works

1. Prompts the user to enter the first number.  
2. Prompts for the second number.  
3. Performs calculations using basic arithmetic operators:
   - `+` for addition  
   - `-` for subtraction  
   - `*` for multiplication  
   - `/` for division  
4. Prints all results line by line.

## 🚀 Running the Program

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### **Steps**
```bash
python ASSIGNMENT_1.py
Enter the first number:
Enter the second number:
Addition: <value>
Subtraction: <value>
Multiplication: <value>
Division: <value>
num_1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num_2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
Addition = num_1 + num_2
Subtraction = num_1 - num_2
Multiplication = num_1 * num_2
Division = num_1 / num_2
print("Addition: ", Addition)
print("Subtraction: ", Subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ", Multiplication)
print("Division: ", Division)
